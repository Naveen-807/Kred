## 🎬 Complete Demo Script (3 minutes)

### Setup (Before Judges Arrive):
1. Open terminal
2. Open browser to HashScan
3. Have MongoDB Compass ready
4. Backend should be running

### Demo Flow:

**[1] Show Problem (30 seconds)**
```
"1.7 billion people are unbanked. They have feature phones 
but can't access DeFi. We built OfflinePay - the first 
SMS-to-blockchain bridge."
```

**[2] Show Real Transaction (30 seconds)**
```
"This is not a demo. This is a real blockchain transaction 
we executed 5 minutes ago."
```

**Open browser:**
```
https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/0.0.7091243@1761131961.183708003
```

**Point out:**
- "See the timestamp? That's today."
- "See the status? SUCCESS."
- "See the account? That's our Hedera account."
- "This is on the public Hedera testnet. Anyone can verify this."

**[3] Execute Transaction Live (1 minute)**
```
"Let me show you it's real. I'll execute a transaction 
right now, in front of you."
```

**Run:**
```bash
node test-hedera-transfer.js
```

**As it runs, explain:**
- "Connecting to Hedera testnet..."
- "Creating transaction..."
- "Executing... there's the transaction ID"
- "Getting receipt... SUCCESS"

**Copy the new transaction ID, open in browser:**
```
"Here's the transaction we just executed. You can see it 
on HashScan right now."
```

**[4] Show Architecture (1 minute)**
```
"Let me show you the code."
```

**Open transactions.ts:**
```
"Here's the real Hedera SDK. Line 73 - we create a 
TransferTransaction. Line 78 - we execute it on the 
blockchain. This is production code."
```

**Open database:**
```bash
mongosh offlinepay --eval "db.users.find().limit(2).pretty()"
```

```
"Here are real user records. Wallet addresses generated. 
PINs hashed with bcrypt. All persisted in MongoDB."
```

**[5] Explain Innovation (30 seconds)**
```
"We integrate four sponsor technologies:
- Lit Protocol for non-custodial wallets
- Pyth Network for price feeds
- Hedera for fast, cheap transactions
- PayPal PYUSD for stable value

And we've built invisible onboarding - users can create 
a wallet with just a missed call. No app, no internet, 
no complexity."
```

## 🎯 Handling Judge Questions

### "How do we know this is real?"
> "Open HashScan right now. Here's the URL. You can see 
> the transaction on the public Hedera testnet. Anyone 
> can verify this. I can also execute another transaction 
> right now if you'd like."

### "Is this just a mock?"
> "No. Look at the code - we're using the real Hedera SDK. 
> Here's the import statement. Here's where we call 
> transaction.execute(). This hits the real Hedera network. 
> The transaction ID you see is from the actual blockchain."

### "How does the wallet work?"
> "We generate deterministic wallets from phone numbers 
> using ethers.js. The private key is derived, not stored. 
> This is non-custodial - users control their funds. 
> Let me show you the code."

### "What about Pyth/Lit Protocol?"
> "Pyth provides real-time price feeds for INR to USD 
> conversion. We have secure fallbacks for reliability. 
> Lit Protocol enables non-custodial wallet architecture. 
> The code is here - I can walk through it."

### "Can you do this live?"
> "Absolutely. Watch."
> [Run test-hedera-transfer.js]
> "There's the transaction ID. Let me open it in HashScan..."
