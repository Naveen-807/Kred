- **Workaround**: SELL command shows confirmation message
- **Production**: Needs Transak API credentials and webhook setup

### Hedera Account Funding
- **Status**: Requires manual HBAR funding from faucet
- **Workaround**: Document in DEPLOYMENT.md
- **Production**: Implement automated funding or fee sponsorship
